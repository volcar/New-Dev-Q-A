**What are some stereotypes you have about software developers?**  
I am just now working on entering the field, well trying to learn my way into the field.  Reading through the minefield of blogs, I believe the main thing that I've come across was that you have to have very strong math skills to develop and write software. 

**Do these stereotypes make you more or less likely to continue in the field of software development?**   
Not at all, after doing more reading and digging I've come to the conclusion that you don't have to be strong in math, just strongminded to learn what needs to be learned in order to succeed.

**What are your thoughts on developers who have degrees vs. those who don't (self taught or only had a class or two)?**  
I think the degree holders have a better background on understanding some of the concepts.  Self-taught developers give inspiration to new developers that are just now starting out or thinking about making a career change. 

**What is impostor syndrome? Have you ever suffered from it?**  
Iâ€™ve always doubted myself.  Joining the Navy and growing up while in it has taught me to work hard and keep pushing your limits. Regardless of what you think you are capable of, just keep pushing and learn from your mistakes.    



**Would you ever consider speaking at a conference or user group?**  
I would love to speak at a conference.  I enjoy public speaking, as long as I study up and know what I am speaking about.  In the Navy I have given countless briefs in front of groups ranging from 4 to the maximum of over 200 personnel.

**Does the idea excite or scare you?**  
**_EXCITES!_**


**What role does personal networking play in finding a job?**  
Networking is **HUGE** in finding employment.  Also, it helps to just get yourself out there and make connections.  This is something I need to work on, hopefully during this training we will all start our own small network and grow together.
