1. **What are some stereotypes you have about software developers?**  

I am just now working on entering the field, well trying to learn my way into the field.  I believe the main thing that I've heard was that you have to have very strong math skills to develop and write software. 

2. **Do these stereotypes make you more or less likely to continue in the field of software development?** 

Not at all, I want to pursue a career and transistion from the military to a junior developer.

3. **What are your thoughts on developers who have degrees vs. those who don't (self taught or only had a class or two)?**

I think the degree holders have a better background on understanding some of the concepts.  

4. **What is impostor syndrome? Have you ever suffered from it?**  

5. **Would you ever consider speaking at a conference or user group?**  

6. **Does the idea excite or scare you?**  

7. **What role does personal networking play in finding a job?**
